  Pick a topic on software or product design about which you have a strong opinion (e.g, what good software development process looks like, or agile methodologies, or front- end frameworks, etc). If your co-workers came to you one day and tried to persuade you that an alternative, opposing approach was superior, how would you respond?

  Write a short document below advocating for your approach.
