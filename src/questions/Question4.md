  Pick a topic on software or product design about which you have a strong opinion (e.g, what good software development process looks like, or agile methodologies, or front- end frameworks, etc). If your co-workers came to you one day and tried to persuade you that an alternative, opposing approach was superior, how would you respond?

  Write a short document below advocating for your approach.

  The disagreement: Giving users fewer vs more options in their apps

  Simplifying software as much as possible, and giving
  users a targeted, smaller suite of powerful features can result in a much more enjoyable, 
  useful product from the users perspective. Only a fraction of software features are ever used, 
  and simplification can enable the best use of business resources (developer & product time)

  There is research that suggests that only a small percentage of software is regularly used (45% is never used),
  so to minimise waste from a business perspective (focusing effort on what is used, and therefore what can make money)
  is more strategic. Iterating quickly through the Lean product development cycle can allow features
  to be quickly tested and retired. Features which are unsuccessful should be removed, as they would otherwise
  have to be maintained for only a small number of users, costing time and money.

  Development time can be spent more strategetically, 
  with the focus being on making the build/measure/learn feedback loop as tight as possible, and tailoring the 
  existing features closely to changing/emerging requirements. More features take more time to build,
  and quality can drop (bugs, poorer team collaboration) when resources are stretched more tightly.
  
  This approach would include simplifying the UI, making the app more intuitive to use, 
  making it easy to complete tasks and to understand pain points
  follow user pathways and make well-followed pathways easier to complete (automation). 
  Simplification also makes it easier to monitor and find errors and bugs.
