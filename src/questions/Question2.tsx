/* 
  Make a React app which
    - accepts a list of words
    - generates "valid" anagrams of each word
    - where "valid" means any word in this wordlist (to be fetched at runtime): http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt

  Bonus points: make the app fun to use (like a game), especially if the user finds a word with many anagrams.
