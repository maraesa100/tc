### Modifications: Question 2

1. I was not able to fetch from the .txt location or use a .txt in the filesystem via fs due 
   to create-react-app stubbing fs.
   Instead, I used a word generator that i grabbed a few thousand words from 
   (not all of them to optimise load speed)
   For this reason, there are only a few matches.

2. I used Material UI and a loader/spinner module .

3. If i was to extend this project, my first steps would be to convert the helpers to TypeScript, 
    change the 'any' types I have used, and extend unit testing and add cypress for e2e. 
    I would probably use styled components, and break out the app into more components

4. Thanks for an enjoyable challenge!
